# Understanding Financial Statements

Financial statements are the backbone of fundamental analysis. Every investor should know how to read and interpret these documents to make informed decisions.

## The Three Core Statements

### 1. Balance Sheet

The balance sheet provides a snapshot of a company's financial position at a specific point in time.

**Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity**

Key components:
- **Current Assets**: Cash, inventory, receivables
- **Fixed Assets**: Property, equipment, buildings
- **Current Liabilities**: Short-term debts, payables
- **Long-term Liabilities**: Bonds, mortgages
- **Shareholders' Equity**: Retained earnings, stock

### 2. Income Statement

The income statement shows a company's profitability over a period of time.

```
Revenue
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
= Gross Profit
- Operating Expenses
= Operating Income (EBIT)
- Interest & Taxes
= Net Income
```

Key metrics to watch:
- Gross margin
- Operating margin
- Net profit margin
- Earnings per share (EPS)

### 3. Cash Flow Statement

The cash flow statement tracks actual cash movement in and out of the business.

Three sections:
1. **Operating Activities**: Day-to-day business operations
2. **Investing Activities**: Asset purchases and sales
3. **Financing Activities**: Debt and equity transactions

## Red Flags to Watch For

When analyzing financial statements, be alert to:

- Declining revenue trends
- Increasing debt levels
- Negative operating cash flow
- Unusual accounting changes
- Large discrepancies between net income and cash flow

## Tools for Analysis

Use financial ratios to compare companies:

| Ratio | Formula | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Current Ratio | Current Assets / Current Liabilities | Liquidity |
| Debt-to-Equity | Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity | Leverage |
| ROE | Net Income / Shareholders' Equity | Profitability |
| P/E Ratio | Stock Price / EPS | Valuation |

## Conclusion

Reading financial statements is a skill that improves with practice. Start by analyzing companies you're familiar with, and gradually expand your knowledge. The Stockie screener can help you filter stocks based on these fundamental metrics.
